# Slot-machine
The code you provided is a C program for a simple console-based slot machine game. It allows players to deposit an amount, choose the number of lines to bet on, and place bets on each line. The program then spins the slot machine and determines if the player has won any prizes based on the matching symbols.

Here is a breakdown of the main components and functionalities of the code:

Header Files:

<stdio.h>: Provides input and output functionality.
<stdbool.h>: Defines the bool type and true and false constants.
<time.h>: Enables the use of time-related functions.
<string.h>: Provides string manipulation functions.
<stdlib.h>: Includes functions for converting strings to integers and generating random numbers.
<ctype.h>: Contains character handling functions.
<conio.h>: Used for console input/output.
Global Variables:

owner_money: Tracks the money earned by the owner of the slot machine.
Function Definitions:

is_valid_number: Checks if a string represents a valid number.
getDeposit: Prompts the player to enter the deposit amount.
getLines: Prompts the player to enter the number of lines to bet on.
getBet: Prompts the player to enter the betting amount.
getRandom: Generates a random number for the slot machine row.
slot_machine_spin: Performs the spinning of the slot machine and determines the outcome of the bet.
main Function:

Prompts the player to enter the deposit amount, number of lines, and betting amount.
Validates the input and ensures the player has sufficient balance.
Gives the player an option to continue or quit the game.
Calls the slot_machine_spin function to start the game.
The code includes error handling to validate user input, calculates winnings, updates balances, and provides options for continuing or quitting the game.

Please note that this is a simple implementation and may not include advanced features or error handling for all possible scenarios. Additionally, the code relies on the availability of the <conio.h> header, which is not a standard C library and may not be available on all systems.

If you have any specific questions about a particular part of the code or need further assistance, please let me know!
